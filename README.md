## Description
This is a code practice challenge from Code Crafters. The solution written by me used the Go. Some parts of the program may be in different sturctures or used different call libraries to achieve similar functions. This is becuase I personally like to try different built-in functions or modules to compare the differences and practice how to use these functions or modules.
